# Sparticles
Particle system written in rust + WGPU + EGUI

## Roadmap
- [ ] Performance test gpu
- [ ] Export (Post fx / animation settings).
- [ ] Seperate post fx settings per spawner
- [ ] Create noise texture for effects
  - [ ] Create these textures in gui

## Gui
- [ ] Show all possible diffuse textures in map
- [ ] Preview mode of textures

## Post fx
- [ ] Depth of view
- [ ] Motion blur
- [ ] Being able to extend Fx State bind groups as long as the order is preserved so you have more
flexibility 

TODO write serialize + deserialize for cgmath vec3 + vec4
